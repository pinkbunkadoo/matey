## What is this?

Matey is a bare-bones 2d animation tool intended for quickly roughing out your
ideas with as few obstacles and bewildering choices as possible. No fancy pens
or brushes. Just simple lines.

Pen strokes are vector based, allowing for a reduced memory footprint and file
size, as well as the ability to manipulate them after they have been put to
paper.

As it stands you are able export your animation as an animated GIF - more
formats are coming.

## Important

Please keep in mind that Matey is a work in progress and as such, some features
are not yet functional. There will also be bugs. Lots of them.

## Installation

Electron and Node.js are required.

```sh
npm install
```

## Running

```sh
electron .
```

## Planned features

 - SVG support (loading and exporting)
 - Export to video (MPEG-4 etc. via ffmpeg)
